# Laboration 5

## Environment & Tools
windows 10 Operating system, CLion 2019.3.3 IDE, Microsoft 
C++ (MSVC) compiler, CMake version: 3.15.6, Git version: 2.25.0.windows.1
## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to train on the use of function objects, Templates, List and iterators and generic 
functions from the Standard Library
## Procedures
To fullfil this purpose, I have written a program that generates and manages random numbers between 1000 and 2000. 
The generated numbers are stored on a list. At the user chooses if the numbers will be of type double or int, after which
a menu is presented with the following options to choose from; Fill list with random numbers, Summerize the values in 
the list, Average of the numbers, Find first number between 1500 and 1900, Divide by two, Swap places, 
Find largest and smallest number, Sort, Clear list, write to file,  Read from file, Print numbers, Quit.
## Discussion
In this lab I practiced the use of Templates in by designing a template class for the list manipulator class 
and the userInterface class. I also practices the use of generic functions and iterators by using generic STL 
functions to sort, clear, swap positions, gets sum and average read file and write to file. I also used the iterator 
to iterate throw list when printing, writing to file or reading from file. I found the Lab presentation very useful.
I believe I have fullfilled the purpose of this lab.
